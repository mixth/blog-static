<p>For those who have just read this for the first time, I have been an exchange student here for almost a year and it was so intense that felt like many years to me. And if the people of this country may allow me to called their home my home too, I will definitely do.</p>
<p>The trip began last year when I set my goal visiting Iceland again. I firstly thought that I would be able to afford all the expenses of being there, confident enough to wrote to my dear host families that I would be there this past summer. But well, it wasn&apos;t as I planned and I almost gave up until my host parents reached me and providing me a round ticket from my home to my... other home.</p>
<p>Oddny and Gudmar, my host family welcomed me at the airport. I honestly had no idea and was a bit nervous to reunited with them again. It was seven years and that was a long time proportionally to my age. But after long warm hugs, exchanging of big smiles, there was no doubts in my mind. Happiness and love filled my little brain and I lost everything I planned to do at the airport.</p>
<p>Driving through Reykjanes peninsula, heading for Reykjavik, I couldn&apos;t stop look out there, to vast lava field. A part of Reykjanesbaer on the left hand-side comprised of Kaflavik and Ytri-Innri Njardvik. Smoke from the famous Blue Lagoon and a road fork out that leads to Grindavik. A scene that I used to see so often, often that it hadn&apos;t been so interested to me until now, until I realized how much I missed them.</p>
<p>Green big smelter aside the coast indicates that we were entering Hafnarfjordur, a city sits next to Gardabaer, Kopovegur, and the mighty Reykjavik. The towns haven&apos;t changed much. I still recognize most of the buildings, highways, and directions to important places back in the days.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2017/11/DSC00272.jpg" alt="Iceland 2017: A Revisit" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Reykjavik was still... <em>Reykjavik</em>. That big landmark church Hallgrimskirkja was being renovated as usual, that famous hotdog stand was full of people as usual. But there were some changes. The downtown street, Bankastraeti, and I believe some part of Laugarvegur were closed for cars. So now we have a wide one-lane road for people shopping. The coffee shop, <em>Espresso Bar</em>, where my friends and I used to hangout was replaced by another coffee shop. And this time, every places I went weren&apos;t full of Icelanders but foreigners.</p>
<p>My host dad, which I called <em>pabbi</em>, told me about how Icelandic tourism industry had been growing for this past few years. Oh, I missed the way westerners, or particularly Icelanders, communicate. They are usually straight-forward and opened when you are one of them. I had many long conversations with my host families and three of my friends here. Mostly update each others about what they are doing, politics and Iceland. Many topics I never had a conversation like this with my parents back home in Thailand. It is really a matter of cultural differences.</p>
<p>I felt like coming home. Once again.</p>

<p>After seeing the movie &quot;The Silent Voice&quot; I have been thinking about many things in the movie which somehow related to my life.</p>
<p>Nishimiya is deaf and was bullied by her classmate in primary school which leaded by Ishida. After she has been bullied for many months, Ishida was blamed for all the action which made Nishimiya changed school then he became a target of hate speeches because of his actions toward her.</p>
<p>After that, Ishida has changed to have a socially isolated personality. He cannot look someone in the eyes, cannot listen to his classmate talking without assuming that they are talking about him.</p>
<p><em>It&apos;s all in his head.</em></p>
<p>I think I have wrote for many times about me being a bad exchange student when I was in Iceland. When I was in school I felt like... a joke. I couldn&apos;t make many friends there because <u>I assumed that they did not like me</u>, a nerd who loves computer talking about news, debating about serious topics, love anime, manga, and books, rather be in a quiet and calm place than being in a club, or loud, and crowd places.</p>
<p>It felt like spotlight was pointed at me not in a good way and similar to Ishida&apos;s. Because of my own personality, the different language and more, I had started to be closed and paranoid when people talking around me. &quot;Are they talking about me?&quot; was always hit as my first thought.</p>
<p><em>It&apos;s all in my head.</em></p>
<p>No. I shouldn&apos;t have thought like that even if it was true or not. Sometimes, ignoring my own one-way &quot;truths&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that I deny all the truths. Sometimes, leaving all heavy thoughts about who likes or hates me is for better.</p>
<p>Oh, if I could be enlightened this way when I were at that age, I would have been happier and more calm with all those situations. At least, now I learned something from that.</p>

<h3 id="chayen">Chayen</h3>
<p>Chayen is a product I worked from January last year. It becomes the new flagship application for Volevi, and I proudly say about my involvement on some decisions and also the whole iOS app.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2017/01/chayen-620x280.png" alt="The Late 2016 Review" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>We got the idea of creating Chayen while we were playing Charades at the company&apos;s Christmas party and we couldn&apos;t find any decent Charades app in the App Store. Chayen has words categorized in to something we called &apos;Deck&apos; which you can choose from many varieties, from anime to zoo! For now, we have our decks in Thai but we also have some in English as well. You can try the app for free at <a href="https://playchayen.com">https://playchayen.com</a></p>
<p>Chayen is the proudest app I have ever made. And I hope it will continue growing and giving fun moments for every users :)</p>
<h3 id="leavingvolevijoinfreelancecommunity">Leaving Volevi &amp; Join Freelance Community</h3>
<p>As I have written earlier in the blog about <a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/04/25/moving-on/">Leaving My First Job</a>. This year, I decided to quit from Volevi and join Odd-e Thailand as a freelancer. Basically, I code for customer of the company and get paid in a daily basis. The best benefit of being the freelancer here is that people here are very talented in what they are doing. They constantly seeks for better ways to improve processes of crafting softwares. I hope I can get some of their awesome behaviors and habits to become a better programmer.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2017/01/15723610_10153984250322047_2827364738749689273_o.jpg" alt="The Late 2016 Review" loading="lazy"><sub><sup>by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/roofimon.class">Twin Panichsombat</a></sup></sub></p>
<h3 id="trustmeihavewatchedit">Trust Me I Have Watched It</h3>
<p>Yes, it is quite a long name for a Facebook page. My friends and I have launched this page to review movies we watch and talk about anything in movie circles.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2017/01/14883708_326355134405390_683351554401121956_o.png" alt="The Late 2016 Review" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>We started it as a hobby that we didn&apos;t expected there would be this much crowd following us up. We have tried posting some facts about real incidents in the movie, we have filmed a 20-minute-long movie review program on YouTube, and we even subbed some trailers to Thai! I don&apos;t know which directions we will go, but we will certainly try as many things as we can imagine.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve tried to runaway from any graphical tasks for... well, almost all my life, because of this page, I am starting to learn some Photoshop stuffs. It really cheers my weekends up :)</p>
<h3 id="drivingtowork">Driving to Work</h3>
<p>I have to admit that I never thought about driving to work everyday like this. Everyday being stressful on the road of Bangkok, which is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2016/03/28/the-worlds-most-traffic-congested-cities-2/#209c4dab5f06">one of the most traffic-congested cities in the world</a>, is really not my thing. Plus, poor Bangkokians&apos; driving style is just so desperate. But believe it or not, I have been driving to work for 7 months. The main reason would be my picky choice of living which is opposed by my budget for housing. The second reason is my parents want everyone to stay home, quite normal for the culture here.</p>
<p>I sometimes cannot stand traffic and those bad manners of people behind the wheels and declare to self that I will give up those picky criteria and just rent some place out.</p>
<p>Well, you see, I&apos;m still unable to rent somewhere. &#x1F602;</p>
<p>At least, the traffic gives me one true knowledge. The truth that there is something that cannot be changed even you try so hard to resist it. Like, when the traffic is really bad and I will definitely be late for work.</p>
<h3 id="2016specialthanks">2016 Special Thanks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volevi</strong> for having me for almost a year and gave me the opportunity to work on Chayen, one of my greatest mobile application so far</li>
<li><strong>P&apos; {Tum, Roof, Jane}</strong> who let me work along side them in Odd-e and teach me so much things about this wide software development world</li>
<li><strong>Oak</strong>, my startup partner, who dare to dream so many crazy things together. We had too few works last year and I&apos;m sorry for that. I hope we learn to fail and success this coming year</li>
<li><strong>P&apos;Puhn</strong> for helping and understanding me about many things in the 2016</li>
<li><strong>My EGCO friends</strong> to organize many fun dinners and trips. I couldn&apos;t have the happy year without you guys :)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2017goals">2017 Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be back in Iceland</strong> -&gt; this might get delayed according to my friend&apos;s and mine financial situations, but I am still being optimistic that I can make it this year</li>
<li><strong>1+ Posts</strong> -&gt; I want to update this blog more frequent. A blog per month sounds great but I can do better</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot think of any more goals right now. I hope I&apos;ll be back and add some later.</p>
<p>Happy 2017 and bye for now!</p>

<p>At the first week camp of AFS Iceland, I wrote two letters, letters to my future self which would be delivered between and at the end of the exchange year.</p>
<p>They were good experiences, seeing how naive and how full-of-happiness I was. I did cry, smile and laugh mixing all emotional feelings all down to the last letter of those letters. But I&apos;ve ignored how greatness this writing-to-future act was.</p>
<p>Until I watch Fanday.</p>
<p>The main character temporarily lost her last 4 years memories and her one-sided creepy follower/lover lied to her that they were couples. But when she found the truth about it, she demanded all the truths. Now she knew about her &quot;future&quot; self being a mistress of her own boss.</p>
<p>It is like time-traveling to the future and seeing how failure you will be, seeing how much have you changed because of time and situations.</p>
<p>What would your younger self speak to you today?<br>
What would my younger self speak to me right now?</p>
<p>He might be happy seeing how much I have come this far.<br>
He might be mad that I haven&apos;t even tried to start some companies.<br>
He might be disappointed that I still don&apos;t have a girlfriend.</p>
<p>I really have no idea, but it&apos;s fun to think about it though.</p>
<p>And maybe, maybe it is a good idea to start recording or writing to you own self in the future. It will be fun, I promise.</p>

It was when my parents, especially my mum, wanted their children to be a doctor.</p>
<p>In Thailand, being anyone who literally help someone is such a noble person to be. Doctor is also one of careers that people &quot;think&quot; can make a lot of money. So, helping people and earning big money, who doesn&apos;t want to be, right? Thousands of students try every year to have a seat in fine academies of medicine.</p>
<p>I somehow have set my goal at being a doctor when I was in high school too. Even I&apos;ve found computer stuffs very fascinated and fun.</p>
<p>Until I met this man Stefan one of my host dads. He was energetic as much as a 30s could be. Of course, I told him about my goals and he told me these lines I will never forget:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about a job that you can get up every morning without feeling bored. If any job makes you feel so different from that, don&apos;t do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn&apos;t exactly like this but the context is right.</p>
<p>As I grow up, I am so certain that sentences above couldn&apos;t be applied to this real life. But it is a great thing to have some ideal cases in mind, isn&apos;t it?</p>

I have read somewhere but I couldn&apos;t find what the quote exactly was, but it goes like &quot;Surround yourself with the people you want to be&quot;.</p>
<p>And that is what my current situation is.</p>
<p>I have been working as a freelancer for Odd-e Thailand for around 2 - 3 months now. At the very beginning of deciding to be their freelancer, my decision was based on many things and one of them was learning as much as I am capable.</p>
<p>Now, I found myself within a group of people. People who believe in self-development, hard-practising and still happily doing those. People who obsess about quality of their works and wanted to improve them as much as they can. I found myself driven in the stream of endless learning and sharing. There are always things to be learnt and things to be mastered. There are always talented people, expertises in domains which I&apos;ve never known about their existences.</p>
<p>The quote is quite correct.</p>
<p>These two or three months have been intense for good. I learnt plenty of things that I didn&apos;t have a chance to learn in school. And I hope that I will continue to be this dry sponge waited to absorb as much culture and knowledge as I can.</p>

<p><strong>This post may contain some spoilers from the movie</strong></p>
<p>In the movie main character, a postman in a rural area of Japan, found out about his terminal tumour. That night, he made a deal with a so-called evil to extend his life one day by erasing one thing from the world. The disappearance would affect every stories, every relations that the main character had ever involved.</p>
<p>One thing the movie showed me is how meaningful things are. In the beginning of the movie, I thought it would be easy to make something disappear from the world. But I turned my attitude 180 degree after walking out of that theater.</p>
<p>Because things don&apos;t just exist, but there are relationships and memories behind them. Like you and me, we have a thing called internet, computers, mobiles, and many little things that play apart.</p>
<p>There are many more philosophies in this movie. If you have a chance to watch it, do watch. You won&apos;t regret, I promise. :)</p>

Most of the time, I hold debating or correcting voice inside of my mind because it may be rude to talk to everyone about every topics, right? But the funny part is: the level of how much I debate or correct someone related to how much I care, how much I feel comfortable, how much I want to have a conversation with someone based on my observations.</p>
<p>It might be because I was growing with my twin brother. Trust me, the childhood was a bit unusual, and we have had many fights over the most tiniest issues. A day without a fight would be such a blessed one for my parents. So, my dad usually came up while we were fighting and told us to stop arguing about such  little things. But we couldn&apos;t. Thus we ended up being more reasonable, still fighting, but using more informative information, and trying to convince each other.</p>
<p>I might not be such a great convincer as my brother, but I somehow addict to have a brainy, energetic talks about others&apos; views even I might look and sound serious.</p>
<p>You might wonder why I want to share this story with you. The truth is: today I had a fight with my dad, a political one. And he, once again, like I was a child, told me to stop arguing about it.</p>
<p>The pain was, he is one of two people I love talking politics to, because both my mom and my dad introduced me to politics and now I wanted to share to them what young people think about the topic too.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I was a bit across the line. My choices of choosing some words before and after his sentence were too idiot.</p>
<p>My brother told me later that even he totally agreed with me, but I should care more about how listeners take my words emotionally. Plus, last week, I was taught about what is NVC - Nonviolent Communication and how to have that in daily life. Oh my, why my head was so void at that moment.</p>
<p>I thought more debating would make people understand more, but it didn&apos;t seem to be true. So should I lie sometimes to protect someone from my real opinions? Is it right to do that to closest circle I have?</p>
<p>Huh...</p>
<p>But for now, just simply think before speak, Mix.</p>

If I failed a subject because I didn&apos;t commit my time at it, I did not study enough. If I passed a subject with an A, it was because I surely study hard. It was so easy to earn achievements that I gave myself like playing some games. But when I start working, I realized that to achieve my objectives and earn my &quot;fake&quot; achievements are not just about me doing things right, but it is every bits of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>It might be about difficulty evaluating my achievements. It might be about setting my objectives stupidly as a newcomer to this new level of life.</p>
<p>One tough thing to think about</p>
<p>Then I have to worry more about money, how much should I save, how to differentiate my needs and wants. I&apos;m panic about the fact that I have only social security service coverage when I should have had some health insurance. I get stressed thinking about how things will work out when my dad retires later this year.</p>
<p>I lost.</p>
<p>I lost my own life objectives for a big moment.</p>
<p>Another things I have lost is joy learning new things I have never known before in this computer field. I committed my workdays for my company&apos;s products and my company&apos;s clients and weekend I keep sleeping like 10 hours and wake up doing nothing. There should be a way to improve my skills and seeing many great people in this field doing something great always helps me.</p>
<p>One of my best friends once said that she wishes money never exists. I argued her so much about everything would be messed up without money as a medium for trading. But now as a grown up, I think deeper to that silly talk I have had in that day.</p>
<p>Money makes me miserable. If I don&apos;t have money to worry about, I will be freed, won&apos;t I?</p>
<p>So I need to have more money. At least, in a volume that I don&apos;t need to be over thought about it. In a volume that I can live on a normal life and buy some safety nets.</p>
<p>Those are why I&apos;m leaving my current job at Volevi this month. To earn more money and get closer to the above statement, to get on track on what I really want to do, to learn more about this vast world of software development, and lastly, to be able to think about my own life objectives again.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t get anything wrong. I have quite a fun ride with Volevi. I learnt Swift and iOS development. I learned to meet with customers and gained much knowledge on handling them. (which I am getting better yet still poorly) They are so generous about everything. But as a situation changes, I feel more responsible to my family and my own dreams.</p>
<p>It was a hard decision for me and I think it would be for someone else in this position too.</p>

Here are some bullet points I caught from the session and are worth sharing.</p>
<p><strong>VIMM model</strong> - reduce users&apos; load on four areas:<br>
Vision, Intellect, Memory and Motor</p>
<h4 id="vision">Vision</h4>
<ul>
<li>Human brains rapidly scan all surface of media. To design a good UX, users are needed to be guided through essential contents</li>
<li>Users don&#x2019;t like to read something too long, they usually scan all document like an F shape</li>
<li>These are prioritized predictions of human brains: Complex Areas, saturated color, dark areas, human faces</li>
<li>Be caution to put any faces in a design. Doing that will attract users to focus on the face rather than a content you want them to know</li>
<li>You need to understand what they expect and design around it. Because people tend to scan based on their expectations</li>
<li>Eliminate all wiggly stuffs from some media that required users to read</li>
<li>Stroop effect: linkage of words and colors - show an importance of content and its physical properties</li>
<li>Red is the most sensitive color on light spectrum -&gt; consider hardly to use red color, pure blue and pure red should never put together (except you want fatal attention: emergency responder vehicles)</li>
<li>Monochrome first then add some color to enhance</li>
<li>Canonic perspective - visual testing, be sure it is the canonic form</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="intellect">Intellect</h4>
<ul>
<li>Humans respond and focus to only one matter</li>
<li>DO NOT expect users to do two things at a time</li>
<li>Hick-Hyman Law -&gt; number of options affects time to respond until at one number, time to respond will not increase anymore
<ul>
<li>Complexity affects time to respond -&gt; design simple stuffs so users can react fast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 - 9 colors are maximum bound of acceptance</li>
<li>If you need more attention and you are running out of colors, use movement, sound, smell or something else</li>
<li>Yerkes-Dodson Law - best performance of humans is found when humans are not too comfortable but not too stress
<ul>
<li>Stressor can be easily distracted</li>
<li>They will redo an unsuccessful over and over again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things cause stress: noise, vibration, heat - cold, dim light, anxiety, anger, time pressure</li>
<li>Better know your users&#x2019; level of arousal - high stress -&gt; design for self-evidence, efficiency and simplicity -&gt; childlike behaviors</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="memory">Memory</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sensory, Short-term, Long-term</li>
<li>Sensory is like a buffer of the brain - too much of information at a time, buffer is flowed</li>
<li>Maximum number that humans can remember is 7 +- 2, practically at 4 digits</li>
<li>Reduce memory load in users, repeat or show them what they&#x2019;re doing (ex. Checkout process with items in cart)</li>
<li>Good designs do not make people to remember a thing
<ul>
<li>Source or encoding message</li>
<li>Recognition is easier than recall - using canonic shapes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Help user to remember: recognition, repetition, association, spatial location, mnemonics, Zeifarnik effect</li>
<li>Schema - a set of fixed information that users use to recognize something
<ul>
<li>Know your user&#x2019;s schema and design around it</li>
<li>Hang new information to existing schema</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whatever you design, control your bias - rethink from users&apos; perspective
<ul>
<li>Users will interpret your designs based on their biases</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="motor">Motor</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fitt&#x2019;s Law - bigger the object, quicker to respond (until at one size, there is no more improvement on speed)
<ul>
<li>Make targets big</li>
<li>Make movement short</li>
<li>Estimate how long the whole process is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Better performance for users doesn&#x2019;t mean better UX. Time of use may change performance for users to get better.</li>
<li>Do research a design for target audience</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="knowyourusers">Know Your Users</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some symbols or signs are not internationally recognized as a same meaning</li>
<li>Customize your design for target audience</li>
</ul>

When I was a child, the reason I want to live longer than I will do, it&apos;s fearing of the afterlife. Because my little scientist brain always tells me that there is no other side. There is just an unconsciousness, feeling or sensing nothing, thinking of nothing.</p>
<p>The idea is so terrified to think of. But when I am getting older, I feel that, if I will be in an extremely painful condition, dying maybe a better choice.</p>
<p>Last night, I was reading some Facebook posts of my friends, talking about AlphaGo taking over the world, computers are extremely dangerous, it even overthrows humans in complex games.</p>
<p>Yes, machine learning is growing and it will learn and conduce a lot of complicated thoughts in the near future. But right now, machines are doing great at what they&apos;re trained for... not EVERYTHING. They wouldn&apos;t think about their our wants if we don&apos;t input their objectives in the first place.</p>
<p>But when it will be good enough? Is it possible for them to have their own consciousness? Actually, it shouldn&apos;t be about possibility of this thing. I should ask &apos;when&apos;. Because I believe we, humans, can accomplish that in the future.</p>
<p>But when?</p>
<p>Am I gonna be alive at the time this happens?<br>
Am I gonna see humans living in the Mars?<br>
Am I gonna see humans traveling through multiple galaxies?</p>
<p>I couldn&apos;t sleep well because of those excitement thinking about them, futuristic events in my imaginations. I hope I could be someone who can accelerate those dreams to become realities. Or I could just be... immortal.</p>

<p>AJ+ is one of Al Jazeera Media Network, very active uploaders, short and informative, easy to watch.</p>
<p>They upload several videos almost every weekdays. The only downside here is some videos may not be narrated, so you need to focus and read them.</p>

<p>TestTube&apos;s hosts have very clear English. It means for non-native English speaker like me, it is easy to listen to. Many topics are not directly current situations, but in-depths or stories behind news. TestTube is owned by Discovery Digital News Network which also has an awesome science channel named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWQYUVCpZqtN93H8RR44Qw">DNews</a>.</p>
<p>TestTube uploads around a video per one weekdays.</p>

<p>Vox has the most beautiful way to create videos compared to other &apos;news&apos; channel. I have to put news inside quotes because they produce a wide range of videos. The first time I found this channel, I couldn&apos;t stop watching those &apos;Up Next&apos; videos from them. You have to watch this channel to understand how creative they are.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRYZjOuUnlU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>There are a lot of interesting channels out there. Next time I will share you more about channels in other topics.</p>

The type of man who gets things done but without a good fundamental knowledge or a deep understanding in them.</p>
<p>Today, I was interviewed by senior iOS developers from another company about my works at the current place I am working in. And I couldn&apos;t answer some of their questions. Questions that I should have known.</p>
<p>Good programmers (well, I think every occupations should too) understand deeply on things they working on, so they can predict or realise every possible scenarios.</p>
<p>My background is, I never developed iOS before, I actually haven&apos;t owned a serious iOS device yet, just one old iPod touch to test. I joined the company and taught myself Swift and iOS development... alone without mentors. So far, I finished 3 apps and another one should be done this week, all this in almost 9 months.</p>
<p>I get the job done... a bit slower than other skilled developers but fast as a starter, I guess.</p>
<p>I somehow addict to those feeling of making things done and smoothly run but without basic understanding on them. It will eventually be difficult for me to climb higher in the learning curve. Or in the other way, I am responsible for making my own curve flatten, more complicated to learn more.</p>
<p>I should have finished those online courses before getting bored and start things on my own.</p>

<p><a href="http://oakraw.com">Oakraw</a> and I, we have a dream creating tech company in Thailand. But we hadn&apos;t been working together before at the time. So, we created PotatoJuice as our POC for our compatibility. It should be around mid-to-late 2014 and then we continued with Moyes project which has been discontinued by me later that year. I rewrote PotatoJuice&apos;s backend all over again in early 2015 using Google Cloud instead of Node.js. That was it. I had zero things done after that. One explanation would be being busy with my senior project and some subject assignments.</p>
<p>Even I have done quite a few iOS projects with Volevi for last 8 months, I think it is not enough.</p>
<p>It&apos;s time. Stop being lazy and do something, now.</p>
<p>This week, I will be back in my form again. We will develop new projects, tech and more. This post is the promise to myself and if I fail to achieve that, I should feel ashamed!</p>

The cart is operated by a &quot;grandma&quot; around her 70s or 80s.</p>
<p>I have hated those roast bananas for a long time, they are too sweet because of syrup dressing. But I haven&apos;t known that there is also the non-syrup version too. So, when my friend brought me this version of banana, I tried it out and fall in love with it.</p>
<p>From that day on, I am a royal customer of grandma&apos;s, because she is the closest one and because her dedication to her products. Here are some details of her dedication.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>She carefully peels bananas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She controls her coal-fueled fire to heat slowly, not rushly done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She always asks how hard banana I want to have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She gently checks bananas to see if they meet my need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She denies to sell her products when they are not ready</p>
