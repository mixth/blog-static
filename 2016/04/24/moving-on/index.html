        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When I was a student in college. If I failed a subject because I didn't commit my time at it, I did not study enough. If I passed a subject with an A, it was because I surely study hard. It was so easy to earn achievements that I gave myself like playing some games. But when I start working, I realized that to achieve my objectives and earn my &quot;fake&quot; achievements are not just about me doing things right, but it is every bits of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>It might be about difficulty evaluating my achievements. It might be about setting my objectives stupidly as a newcomer to this new level of life.</p>
<p>One tough thing to think about</p>
<p>Then I have to worry more about money, how much should I save, how to differentiate my needs and wants. I'm panic about the fact that I have only social security service coverage when I should have had some health insurance. I get stressed thinking about how things will work out when my dad retires later this year.</p>
<p>I lost.</p>
<p>I lost my own life objectives for a big moment.</p>
<p>Another things I have lost is joy learning new things I have never known before in this computer field. I committed my workdays for my company's products and my company's clients and weekend I keep sleeping like 10 hours and wake up doing nothing. There should be a way to improve my skills and seeing many great people in this field doing something great always helps me.</p>
<p>One of my best friends once said that she wishes money never exists. I argued her so much about everything would be messed up without money as a medium for trading. But now as a grown up, I think deeper to that silly talk I have had in that day.</p>
<p>Money makes me miserable. If I don't have money to worry about, I will be freed, won't I?</p>
<p>So I need to have more money. At least, in a volume that I don't need to be over thought about it. In a volume that I can live on a normal life and buy some safety nets.</p>
<p>Those are why I'm leaving my current job at Volevi this month. To earn more money and get closer to the above statement, to get on track on what I really want to do, to learn more about this vast world of software development, and lastly, to be able to think about my own life objectives again.</p>
<p>Don't get anything wrong. I have quite a fun ride with Volevi. I learnt Swift and iOS development. I learned to meet with customers and gained much knowledge on handling them. (which I am getting better yet still poorly) They are so generous about everything. But as a situation changes, I feel more responsible to my family and my own dreams.</p>
<p>It was a hard decision for me and I think it would be for someone else in this position too.</p>
