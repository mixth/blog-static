        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>2015 is here~! Happy new year everyone :)</p>
<p>This year, I will become 22 years old. I will finish my degree (hopefully) and I will be an adult, making my own livings. So, here I am, writing commitments to myself.</p>
<h3 id="beseriousaboutstartup">Be serious about startup</h3>
<p>oakraw, my college friend, who is really great at doing mobile apps, invited me to start a startup company together. At that time, I was not serious about it, I mean, I wished to create a company that has a great culture and fun to run it, but I don't think I can do it. I don't have social skills not even a bit of senses on those.</p>
<p>My parents want me to continue studying and finish doctoral degree, which I cannot resist somehow. Unfortunately, I've missed. I missed studying TOEFL and IELTS and taking those exams and all deadlines seem to be in this coming January.</p>
<p>It is such great excuse to have a half year to prove about our startup business, isn't it? Well, it can be my secondary job. I'm interested in joining a small to medium size company to learn about being employed and company management.</p>
<p>Anyway, we're doing a conceptural app. It is not even close to a WOW app and we still couldn't figure it out how to make money about it yet. Hopefully, we gain some users and some money to continue create wow apps in the future.</p>
<h3 id="bemoresocialized">Be more socialized</h3>
<p>I am not socialized person. I love my independency of doing anything on my own, dress as I like to, avoid talking in a topic I hate. That isn't gonna work out as an adult nor a person who is doing business.</p>
<p>This year, I will improve my social skills. I will make more friends, go out to more meeting that I usually reject, and try accepting about social things.</p>
<h3 id="learnjapaneseandimproveenglish">Learn Japanese and improve English</h3>
<p>Last year, I took an elementary Japanese course in uni. To know only Thai and not-so-great English is not good enough. So, I decided to learn Japanese as my third (or fifth, if you count what I've learnt and forgotten; Chinese and Icelandic) language. Know fews is better than know nothing, right?</p>
<p>Also my English... some says it's better than their English but it's not good enough in a professional career. I need to improve this.</p>
<h3 id="careabouthealthissues">Care about health issues</h3>
<p>I have hard time agreeing to my common senses that I'm getting old and I need to be more careful about my health issues. I need to get moving in some kinds. I hope this new year, I will do more jogging or cycling around my campus and continue doing so even I have a job.</p>
<h3 id="updatethisblogatleastonceamonth">Update this blog at least once a month</h3>
<p>I read back in this blog and found many memorial articles. Reading this blog is like meeting young me again. But these years, this blog was almost empty and I would not meet this time's me again. This year, I promise to write at least once a month for my future me meeting this me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Happy new year again! and if you are not myself reading back in time, thanks for reading these personal notes! I don't understand why these blog posts are charming but I'm so happy you find it that way ;P</p>
