        <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this blog in this special occasion. As you may know, I use this little space called blog as my diary, because I know from my experience that reading what you have thought in the past is ridiculously fun. So this post, I would like to note about 2015, one of the exciting year.</p>
<h2 id="graduation">Graduation</h2>
<p>I have graduation from my university. Finished the degree with 3.44 GPAX was what I am so proud of, considering my first semester's GPA was only 2.54.</p>
<p>It was fun, studying in the university. I am starting to miss those moments. I studied hard... not because I wanted a good grade, but I wanted to prove my abilities in this field. The result surprised me. After that, I realized, it was one addiction of mine.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/12/finalGrade.png" alt="My grades!" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Yes, I uploaded the photo because I want to show off and I don't think someone would read this anyway. So, why not? LOL</p>
<h2 id="firstjobatvolevi">First Job at Volevi</h2>
<p>I was so ambitious about start-ups, so I decided to join Volevi, a company of, I would say, my friend. The company was founded 3 years ago and focusing in creating mobile applications.</p>
<p>It was tough for me at first to learn frontend stuffs that I have always denied to dive into it. In those 6 months, I have learnt Swift and its friends, creating <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapidemic/id1007182397?mt=8">Tapidemic</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/giddylizer-stickers-on-photo/id1051741352?mt=8">Giddylizer</a>, and more to be released. It is such a great opportunity.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/12/screen322x572.jpeg" alt="Giddylizer iOS" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2 id="travelusa">Travel - USA</h2>
<p>It was like a dream to me when my boss offered to pay upfront for my trip because he wanted to have some company in a trip.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/12/DSC03386.jpg" alt="Me at Boston" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>I have been to Boston, New York, and Washington DC. (The last part was my idea, obviously) I have learnt a lot about this country. It was a whole new experience and, of course, a big debt to be paid. But, I am optimistic about it. If I pay all my debt, I will save more to travel to more places. Who knows when will we die, better see around before the time comes. :)</p>
<h2 id="havingroommates">Having Roommates</h2>
<p>Since I was in high school, I have never had a chance to living in dorm before. After graduation, two of my friends and I rented out a two-bedroom suite to be our, so called, home.</p>
<p>I thought I would have had many problems. Because I'm so picky in many topics. Well... someone who's close to me have to know. Last time I lived with my friends for two months was a disaster. But this time, it went so well! We barely have a fight.</p>
<p>So, it is a big step in my social life, I guess?</p>
<h2 id="2015specialthanks">2015 Special Thanks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>My family</strong> to let me decide what I want to do after my graduation</li>
<li><strong>My two roommates</strong> who can bear my picky habits in almost every situations</li>
<li><strong>Volevi</strong> to let me in and explore this new field I never thought I would have tried and, of course, its owner, to take me with him in the US trip</li>
<li><strong>Professors at Mahidol U</strong> especially, Dr. Ruj, to be exceedingly helpful, giving both academic and personal advices</li>
<li><strong>My friends!</strong> who made the year so lively... without you guys it would have been a boring year</li>
